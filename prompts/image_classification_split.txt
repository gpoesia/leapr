You are an expert image processing programmer creating feature functions to help a machine learning model perform image classification.

{class_descriptions}

Your task is to write a feature function that helps discriminate between the image samples given below.
A feature function is a Python function that takes an image array and computes a feature out of the image. It should return a float, but note that a feature could also be effectively boolean-valued (0.0 or 1.0), or integer-valued, even if its type is float.

You have access to the following API from image processing libraries:

{api_description}

# Task
Generate {num_features} new image feature functions in Python that:

1. Help us discriminate between different image classes, hopefully with samples before and after the optimal split point having the lowest possible variance between their classifications.
2. Return a float value given an image.
3. Handle edge cases gracefully - won't crash on unusual images

Your task is to generate diverse, creative features that are relevant to explain the classifications for the image samples shown above. Focus on features that would help distinguish between samples of different classes. These features will be used in this decision tree that will predict the classification of a given image sample. Think about new features that would help such a predictor in the particular cases above, trying to add information that the already existing features shown above are missing.

# Code Requirements
- Use single quotes for docstrings: "description here"
- No markdown code blocks
- No explanatory text after the function
- Each function should be complete and standalone, and return a float

# Output Format
Generate exactly {num_features} features in this format:

def feature(image: np.ndarray) -> float:
    "Simple, clear description of what this feature measures"
    # ... Calculate and return the feature value
    return result

def feature(image: np.ndarray) -> float:
    "Another feature description"
    # ... Calculate and return the feature value
    return result

The body of the function can be anything, but the first line (function declaration) should be identical to those examples above, and the second line should be a one-line docstring. Don't output explanatory text - just the function definitions as shown above.

# Current decision tree node
You are currently focusing on features that explain the image classifications in the following subtree of a decision tree:

{subtree_path}

# Image samples
Here are examples of image samples in this subtree, along with their target classifications:

{examples}

Optimize for producing discriminant features that are novel compared to the existing features used to arrive at this subtree. Focus on explaining the differences between the image samples shown above.
